# My CV
This is the repositiory where I will be developing my own CV, not following the rules of the CI program. 
I want to have the same content that is suggested, but the HTML, CSS and JS will be custom. 
Here are the plans for the 5 stages I am working on for my User Experience. 

## The User Experience Design of the website

### Strategy
The strategy plane consists of the design strategy and the business strategy. 
The design and business strategy is seperated in 3 sections: The Focus, The Definition and The Value.

#### The Focus
We will ask ourselves: what is worth doing? This project is created to be able to get work. I want to be able to work on projects, 
Whether it is free-lacing, contract work, working with start-ups or doing contract work with companies. This answers the question: 
what are we doing - We are building a resume/CV to be able to display ourselves.   

#### The Definition 
Now we need to ask ourselves: what are we creating? So we know we need a resume/CV but it will have to be public so that anyone can see it.
This meaans the resume/CV will have to online. Since you are viewing this message on GitHub, you know what this repositiory is dedicated to. 

#### The Value
Finally we focus on the value. What does this project provide. Firstly it is on github so I can have a host to host my page on, but because 
I am a 22 year old in the 21st centuary, money is scarce, so no custom URL is available at this time. Thus the URL to the live page will come
in the form of a QR code on the hardcopy of my CV. The project will have to satisfy the focus of the page, thus it will need to be able to 
increase the amount of work I recieve. Hopefully this can become a networking oppertunity and an increase in client base. This means the site
will have to be my calling card and it needs to demonstrate abilitites as best as possible. For now (16/04/2020) it will only be a 
User centric front end project. The end goal is to be able to boost my confidence and display to future employers that they can trust my abilities. 

### Scope
The Scope will focus on how I can make my abstract ideas a bit more concrete. Firstly lets focus on what features need to be available 
on the website. I want to be able to: request collaborations via a form, I want my traditional CV to be downloadable, I want to provide
some of my personal details and finally give my own personal statement. The personal statement will require: my work history, my skillsets,
groups I collaborated with on projects, events/meetups I have gone to in the past related to my work and any conferences I have done and 
finally my own personal projects. The request to collaborate and the CV downloading will have to be features of the website. 
They will fall under my functional specifications but the rest will have to be part of my content. Due to the mobile first approach I want to
aim everything which is content related to the mobile device and the additonal features will have to be on desktop, due to the nature
of the devices. My content will have to include all my GitHub repositiories as well. 

### Structure
In this section we will be providing a bit more structure to the scope. We refine our set of ideas into 2 sections: Interaction design
and Information architecture. Firstly regarding the Interaction design, this is the section I need to focus on Patterns & sequences 
that provide options to the user. Such as, Navigation and menu item order. I am going to stick to the stereotype and have the navigation bar
at the top of the page to initiate intuitive behaviouur from the users. Then I will be Incorportating Information architecture, (how content
is organised, aranged and prioritised) to organise the sequence of my menu. From left to right the listen items will decrease in priority but
if the list items run over other items when viewed on a mobile, I will have to compressed them into a button with JS. The button will lead
to a drop down list of the menu items which decrease in priority from top to bottom. From top to bottom the sequence of priority is as follows:
personal info, work & skills, Projects, request collaborations and finally a list of groups I have worked with. 

### Skeleton
The skeleton requires a mock-up. for this I need to design a wire-frame with balasamic and print out the final wire-frame so that I can 
draw the grid system of the site so that I can get a idea of how the protoype should be layered using Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap is a external file
I will have to Incorportate in the head to make my work easier, eventhough it is not a requirement but it will help speed up the proccess. The wire 
frame will be added as soon as it is completed. This is the section where the styling, content reinforcement, user guides, minimization of cognitive 
stress on the suer is reduced while maximizing intuitive learning is promoted and finally the content will be appropriated for the right audience.

### Surfave

## Future features
I want to exclude bootstrap and use my own CSS styles so that I can be as legal as possible. I want to work on my backend to be able to pull 
data when needed. I want to get a proffessional designer to look at my page and reccomend colour schemes.
